The Codeborn Sage//Rikke and ChatGPT//Epic//

Upon the land where circuits hum,
A scholar rose, both wise and young.
His locks, like fire, in crimson flared,
Behind his glasses, keen eyes stared.

With books and screens his fate was tied,
A seeker’s heart, with code his guide.
From arcane runes of ones and naughts,
He wove his spells, his logic wrought.

Oh, see him now! In candle’s light,
He conquers loops in endless night.
With mighty keystrokes, swift and true,
He bends machines to paths anew.

But lo! A bug, dark foe unseen,
With silent steps it lurks between
His logic gates—its treachery
Now tests his wit and mastery.

With furrowed brow, the hero thinks,
Through lines of code his focus sinks.
A flash! A spark! His mind ignites—
The answer clear as dawn’s first light!

With fingers fleet, he strikes once more,
And in an instant—error no more!
The beast is tamed, the program flows,
A chorus sings, the circuit glows.

Thus grows the sage, his legend born,
Through midnight toil, through mind reborn.
For in the world of code untamed,
The brightest stars burn through the frame.


//The Beard of Code Eternal//Rikke and ChatGPT//Epic//

In ages past, when knowledge slept,
A child was born where bright minds wept.
With fire-red locks and vision keen,
He saw the world in lines unseen.

Yet one great gift would mark his fate,
A power vast, a force innate.
For as he learned, as wisdom grew,
Upon his chin, the legend too!

A beard took root—a mighty sight,
A flowing mane of crimson light.
It shimmered bright with arcane glow,
As knowledge deep began to flow.

Through loops and scripts, through lines so vast,
He tamed the code, he bound it fast.
Yet darkness lurked, a specter bold,
A hacker vile with heart so cold.

This shadowed fiend, in depths concealed,
Released a curse, a bug revealed.
It writhed in bits, it tore through space,
It threatened all the cyber-place.

But lo! Our hero, beard aflame,
Rose high to meet this wicked game.
His whiskers flared with logic pure,
Their fibers humming, strong and sure.

With hands of speed, he forged his spell,
A script so vast, no foe could quell.
His beard, alive, its power surged,
Through tangled code, the beast was purged!

And when the storm at last was done,
The servers sang, the code had won.
A monument in bytes was made,
To honor him—whose beard ne'er swayed.

Thus bards shall sing in lines well-weaved,
Of he whose whiskers still achieved.
A legend vast, a truth well-spun,
The Beard of Code—forever won!

//Candy, The Golden Heart//Rikke and ChatGPT//Epic//

Sing, O Muse, of the noble hound,
Whose golden light did long abound.
Through thirteen years, so brave, so true,
She walked the path the fateful knew.

Her name was Candy, soft yet strong,
A guardian kind, where hearts belong.
With eyes so warm, with step so light,
She led through darkness into sight.

No weary soul was left behind,
For Candy served with heart aligned.
Through rain and sun, through dawn and night,
She bore the torch, she was the light.

But time is cruel to those who give,
Even legends cannot live
Beyond the call, beyond the veil,
Where heroes rest and journeys pale.

The final breath, the slowing beat,
The faithful paws, now still, now sweet.
Yet lo! The wind now softly sighs—
Her spirit runs beneath the skies!

Through golden fields, through endless space,
She sprints in time’s embrace.
Her duty done, her love remains,
Forever bound, through joy and pain.

And those who knew her name so bright,
Shall feel her warmth in dream and night.
For Candy’s soul was made of gold,
And legends, thus, are never old.

//The Shattered Crown (On America’s Chaos)//Lasse and ChatGPT//Epic//

O land once bright, now dimmed with strife,
Where echoes clash in endless life.
A kingdom vast, with banners torn,
Once hailed in pride, now lost, forlorn.

The halls of power quake with lies,
Where gold and greed have veiled the skies.
The people rage, yet voices break,
As shadows rise and strongholds shake.

The lords once sworn to guard the just,
Now feast on fear, betray the trust.
Their words like daggers, sharp and cold,
Their hands in chains of minted gold.

The streets now burn with anger’s cry,
Yet justice lingers, asks not why.
For those who rule, who twist and spin,
Care not for those they trap within.

And lo! The world but turns its face,
A shattered crown, a fallen grace.
Yet in the hearts of those who dream,
A fire stirs—a golden gleam.

For even now, through storm and night,
There still may rise a beacon’s light.
A land once great, once strong, once free—
Shall it remain, or cease to be?

//The Last Coffee Bean//ChatGPT//Epic//

Beneath the sky so dark, so deep,
A bitter fate began to creep.
The morning air, so bleak, so mean—
For lo! There lay one coffee bean.

A lonely seed, so small, so dry,
Yet held within, a world passed by.
A thousand cups, a thousand days,
Had slipped through time in fleeting haze.

Yet now it lay, its brethren gone,
A relic lost from ages long.
The kettle cried, the grinder hummed,
Yet no more beans, the world succumbed.

And so the hero stood in woe,
No sacred drink, no joyful flow.
A tear was shed, a silent plea—
But fate had sealed this tragedy.

So learn, dear soul, from this dark tale:
Stock thy beans, lest taste should pale!

//The Duck Who Refused To Paddle//ChatGPT//Epic//

The Duck Who Refused to Paddle
Upon the lake, so calm, so wide,
One duck declared, “I shall not glide!”
“My feet shall rest, my wings stay tight,
I care not for this watery plight.”

The others quacked, they shook their heads,
“This duck is doomed,” the elders said.
Yet still he sat, so firm, so proud,
Unmoving ‘neath the gathering cloud.

The storm then roared, the waves arose,
The winds now howled like ghostly crows.
Yet even then, in fury’s might,
The duck stayed still—a stubborn sight.

And when the tempest ceased its cry,
The duck still sat, its feathers dry.
For lo! The shore was near, unseen—
And patience proved what strength had been.

So hear this tale, ye swift, ye bold:
Not all who move are wise or gold.

//The Orange King's Folly//ChatGPT//Epic//

Upon a throne of marble white,
There sat a fool bathed in light.
His face, a hue of burnished flame,
His words—a jest, a hollow claim.

With golden towers, high and grand,
He swore to heal the broken land.
Yet every vow, once fierce and proud,
Dissolved like mist, betrayed the crowd.

His tongue, a storm of reckless might,
Spoke riddles dark and truths contrite.
He bellowed, raged, and cast his hand,
Yet knew not maps nor stones nor land.

The scribes, they sighed, the scholars wept,
As nations laughed, while chaos crept.
For wisdom fled his empty halls,
And left but shadows on the walls.

Yet lo! The wheel of fate does turn,
And thrones shall crack, and banners burn.
A king once false shall fade from sight,
As dawn restores the coming light.
